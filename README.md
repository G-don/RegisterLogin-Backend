##Description

This was my curiosity to better understand what goes on under the hood of a login register backend. It was quite a challenge and allowed me to get the know how to do a register/login whenever I need to, and most certainly I will be using it in the near future! This simple program, which among other features, has password encoder, email validation and email confirmation with 15m time to activate account. 


##Features

This will be developed as a front-end and applied to a new API that I will develop. 

##Visuals

To help you better understand the flow and functionality of this portfolio website I have included a package of screenshots.
